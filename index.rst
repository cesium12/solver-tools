Manic Sages solver-tools
========================

**Solvertools** is a Python library for solving puzzles.

To use Solvertools, you will need to be familiar with using an interactive
Python prompt (such as IPython_). However, some of its features are available
through a Web interface at http://clue.manicsages.org.

.. _IPython: http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/

This code belongs to the Manic Sages. If you're using it on another team,
that's the same as if you walked into our HQ and started copying down
blackboards. It's cheating. Good teams don't cheat.

**Authors:** Rob Speer, Alex Schwendner, Daniel Gulotta, Jason Alonso, Alan
Huang, and Lori Thomas
