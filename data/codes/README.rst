Codes
=====

This directory contains various sets of things for which there are
alphabetic codes.

`airports.txt`
    A tab-delimited file listing airports by IATA code (the familiar
    one), ICAO code, approximate airport name, and approximate place
    name.  This list comes from Wikipedia's 'List of airports by ICAO
    code'.  The formatting has been substantially cleaned, but the
    airport and place names may still contain various irregularities.
    Some of the airports have been closed, usually indicated by a
    parenthetical note after the airport name.

    codes.

`country.txt`
    A list of ISO 3166-1 country names and corresponding two-letter
    country codes.  Note that the Vatican is listed twice, once under
    VATICAN CITY STATE and once under HOLY SEE (but with the same
    country code).  Source:
