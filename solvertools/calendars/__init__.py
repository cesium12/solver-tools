# Currently, this directory contains only `pycalcal.py`, by Enrico Spinielli.
#
# pycalcal is distributed as literate code; I built it, left out most of the
# machinery, and only included the resulting .py file and the .pdf of
# documentation. You can find the rest at http://code.google.com/p/pycalcal/.
