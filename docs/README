The documentation system for solver-tools is called Sphinx.
Documentation on it is available here:

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html

The top-level index document is index.rst in the top of the
repository, and the documentation can be built by use of the Makefile
also in the top-level directory.

The documentation is automatically rebuilt hourly and served from:

https://svn.manicsages.org/docs/solver-tools/
