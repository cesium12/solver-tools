Automated sphinx-based documentation system
===========================================

The documentation system for solver-tools is called Sphinx.
Documentation on it is available at
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html.

The top-level index document is :file:`index.rst` in the top of the
repository, and the documentation can be built by use of the
:file:`Makefile` also in the top-level directory.

The documentation is automatically rebuilt hourly and served from
https://svn.manicsages.org/docs/solver-tools/.
